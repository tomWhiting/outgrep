## üéØ Core Platform Features

### 1. Code Metrics & Quality Analysis

**Objective**: Provide comprehensive code quality insights using industry-standard metrics.

#### Key Metrics
- **Basic counts**: Lines of code, comments, documentation, blank lines
- **Complexity metrics**: Cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity, N-path complexity
- **Maintainability**: Maintainability index, Halstead metrics
- **Quality indicators**: Function/class counts, dependency analysis

#### Implementation Approach
- **Primary tool**: `rust-code-analysis` (Mozilla's production code analysis engine)
  - Supports 20+ languages with consistent tree-sitter parsing
  - Provides 11 maintainability metrics including industry standards
  - Battle-tested in Firefox development workflow
- **Performance**: `tokei` for fast line counting (150+ languages, 50M+ files/second)
- **Language-specific**: Custom analyzers for advanced language features

```rust
pub struct CodeMetrics {
    // Basic metrics
    lines_of_code: u64,
    comment_lines: u64,
    documentation_lines: u64,
    blank_lines: u64,
    
    // Quality metrics
    cyclomatic_complexity: u32,
    cognitive_complexity: u32,
    maintainability_index: f64,
    halstead_metrics: HalsteadMetrics,
    
    // Advanced analysis
    npath_complexity: u64,
    dependency_count: u32,
    function_count: u32,
    class_count: u32,
}
```

### 2. Git Integration & History Analysis

**Objective**: Provide deep insights into code evolution, collaboration patterns, and change frequency.

#### Git Diagnostics
- **File status**: Modified, staged, untracked files with diff statistics
- **Change analysis**: Addition/deletion patterns, churn metrics, refactor ratios
- **Collaboration**: Author diversity, commit frequency, contribution patterns
- **Hotspot detection**: Files that change frequently (maintenance burden indicators)

#### Implementation Approach
- **Primary library**: `git2-rs` (official libgit2 Rust bindings)
  - Thread-safe operations with proper memory management
  - Full feature parity with git command-line tools
  - Excellent performance for repository analysis
- **Advanced analysis**: Custom algorithms for hotspot detection and collaboration metrics

```rust
pub struct GitDiagnostics {
    // File status
    status: GitFileStatus,
    staged: bool,
    diff_stats: DiffStats,
    
    // Change analysis  
    hotspot_score: f64,
    churn_metrics: ChurnMetrics,
    author_diversity: u32,
    
    // History
    commit_history: Vec<CommitInfo>,
    contributors: Vec<Author>,
    file_age: Duration,
    stability_score: f64,
}
```

### 3. Test Coverage & Results Integration

**Objective**: Provide comprehensive test coverage analysis with support for multiple formats and frameworks.

#### Coverage Analysis
- **Multi-format support**: LCOV, Cobertura, JSON, native Rust formats
- **Coverage types**: Line, branch, function, and region coverage
- **Test association**: Intelligent discovery of test files related to source code
- **Trend tracking**: Coverage evolution over time with regression detection

#### Implementation Approach
- **Coverage tools**: Integration with `tarpaulin`, `grcov`, `cargo-llvm-cov`
- **Format parsing**: Custom parsers for LCOV, Cobertura XML, JSON formats
- **Test discovery**: Pattern-based and import-based test file association
- **Framework detection**: Support for major testing frameworks across languages

```rust
pub struct TestDiagnostics {
    // Coverage metrics
    line_coverage: f64,
    branch_coverage: Option<f64>,
    function_coverage: Option<f64>,
    
    // Test associations
    associated_test_files: Vec<TestAssociation>,
    test_framework: Vec<TestFramework>,
    
    // Quality analysis
    test_results: Vec<TestResult>,
    coverage_trend: Vec<CoveragePoint>,
    test_quality_score: f64,
    coverage_gaps: Vec<UncoveredRegion>,
}
```

### 4. Predictive Maintenance & Intelligence

**Objective**: Use machine learning and statistical analysis to predict maintenance needs and identify technical debt.

#### Predictive Features
- **Technical debt detection**: High complexity + low coverage + frequent changes
- **Maintenance risk scoring**: ML-powered risk assessment based on multiple factors
- **Defect probability**: Statistical models for predicting bug likelihood
- **Refactor prioritization**: Data-driven recommendations for code improvements

#### Implementation Approach
- **Risk modeling**: Statistical analysis combining complexity, coverage, and change metrics
- **Pattern recognition**: Historical analysis to identify maintenance patterns
- **Trend analysis**: Time-series analysis for predicting future maintenance needs

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Incremental Processing Engine

**Design**: Event-driven architecture with intelligent change detection and incremental updates.

```rust
pub struct DiagnosticEngine {
    file_watcher: FileWatcher,          // Real-time file system monitoring
    git_monitor: GitMonitor,            // Git status and change detection  
    coverage_watcher: CoverageWatcher,  // Test coverage file monitoring
    
    // Processing pipeline
    change_detector: ChangeDetector,
    dependency_graph: DependencyGraph,
    update_scheduler: UpdateScheduler,
    
    // Caching and state
    cache: MultiLevelCache,
    state: Arc<DiagnosticState>,
}
```

**Key Features**:
- **Real-time updates**: Sub-second response to file changes using `notify` crate
- **Incremental processing**: Only reanalyze changed files and their dependencies
- **Dependency tracking**: Understand impact of changes across the codebase
- **Intelligent scheduling**: Prioritize updates based on file importance and change frequency

#### 2. Multi-Level Caching System

**Design**: Three-tier caching strategy optimized for different access patterns and data types.

```rust
pub struct DiagnosticCache {
    // L1: Hot data (frequently accessed, LRU eviction)
    hot_cache: moka::future::Cache<PathBuf, FileIndex>,
    
    // L2: Session data (concurrent access during analysis)  
    session_cache: DashMap<PathBuf, CachedDiagnostics>,
    
    // L3: Expensive operations (git blame, coverage parsing)
    expensive_cache: moka::future::Cache<String, ExpensiveResult>,
}
```

**Performance Benefits**:
- **L1 Cache**: Sub-millisecond access to frequently used file diagnostics
- **L2 Cache**: Lock-free concurrent access during parallel processing
- **L3 Cache**: Avoid expensive git operations (blame, log traversal)

#### 3. Query Engine & Intelligence Layer

**Design**: Unified query interface combining textual, semantic, and diagnostic search capabilities.

```rust
pub enum DiagnosticQuery {
    // Quality-based queries
    HighComplexity { threshold: u32 },
    LowTestCoverage { threshold: f64 },
    TechnicalDebt { complexity_threshold: u32, coverage_threshold: f64 },
    
    // Git-based queries  
    RecentlyModified { days: u32 },
    HotspotFiles { commit_threshold: u32 },
    AuthorAnalysis { author: String, timeframe: Duration },
    
    // Combined intelligence
    SemanticWithDiagnostics { text: String, filters: DiagnosticFilters },
    PredictiveAnalysis { risk_factors: Vec<RiskFactor> },
    MaintenancePriority { sort_by: PriorityMetric },
}
```
